# Real-Time-Customer-Success-Monitoring-Anomaly-Detection

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Disclaimer**: Due to NDA restrictions, this repository provides only a high-level overview of the project. Proprietary data, code, and sensitive details cannot be shared.  

## üìñ Project Overview  
This project focused on **designing and implementing a real-time monitoring and anomaly detection system** to improve patient outcomes and operational efficiency.  

By building predictive models for weight loss outcomes and automating data workflows, the dashboard addressed the critical challenge of **delayed identification of poor-outcome patients**, enabling **timely intervention strategies**.  


## ‚ú® Key Highlights  

- **Real-Time Monitoring & Anomaly Detection**  
  - Built a system powered by **Tableau dashboards** to track patient progress in real-time (daily basis). 
  - Reduced data latency by **90‚Äì95%**, ensuring up-to-date decision-making.  

- **Predictive Modeling**  
  - Established a model for **weight loss outcome prediction**.  
  - Enabled earlier identification of poor responders, ensuring **timely intervention strategies**.  

- **Automation & Workflow Optimization**  
  - Developed automated ETL data workflows.  
  - Eliminated **95% of manual reporting work**, saving **8 hours per week**.  

- **Impact on Patient Outcomes**  
  - Improved intervention outcomes by **55%**.  
  - Empowered clinical and customer success teams to act **faster and more effectively**.  


## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack  
- **Visualization & Monitoring**: Tableau  
- **Data Processing**: SQL, Python (pandas, scikit-learn)  
- **Workflows & Automation**: Automated ETL pipelines, scheduling  
- **Predictive Modeling**: Regression model


## üöÄ Impact  
- Reduced **data latency by 90‚Äì95%**, enabling near real-time monitoring.  
- Saved **8+ hours of manual effort per week** by eliminating manual reporting.  
- Improved outcomes by **55%** through **timely interventions**.  
- Strengthened customer success and clinical operations with **automated, data-driven insights**.
